<h1 class="title">China travelogue</h1>
<p class="author">Sep 18 – Oct 2, 2023</p>
</header>
<h1 id="mon-sep-18">Mon Sep 18</h1>
<p>Landed in 郑州 (Zhengzhou). Once the plane landed, everyone got up
(as you do) to start grabbing bags in the overhead bins. But then, there
was an announcement telling everyone to sit down. The announcement asked
that anyone on the plane feeling unwell should raise their hand (I heard
a few stifled snickers). No one raised their hand.</p>
<p>Next was immigration. I had to fill out an arrival card about where
I’m staying, with who, etc. But I don’t have 萍圆’s (Pingyuan’s)
address. I also couldn’t get on the wi-fi (to ask her on WeChat) because
you need a Chinese phone number to connect to the free airport wi-fi.
Apparently, you need an invitation letter in this situation now. This
was news to the few other folks trying to pass through immigration.
There was just one guy manning the counter where you fill out the
arrival forms. He was bouncing between 3 or 4 of us—though I was the
only one who could answer his questions in Chinese (brag). I couldn’t
quite tell, but it seems his job was to contact whoever was listed on
our arrival cards and confirm the information (even if you had an
official invitation letter). He tried to get me on his phone’s hotspot
to try to contact 萍圆 on WeChat, but for some reason it couldn’t
connect. At this point, another staff, a woman, came to the counter to
help the lone guy. She called 萍圆’s Chinese phone number and confirmed
the info, and wrote in 萍圆’s address on the arrival card.</p>
<p>Okay, next was the actual immigration officer. I gave him the arrival
card. He asked the purpose of my visit (in English). I said “travel”
which I realize was not one of the choices listed on the arrival card
though I would synonymize it with “tourism” which was listed on the card
(I was tired). He looked confused. So then I said “旅游” (“lüyou”, means
travel/tourism). Okay, now we’re cooking. Then, he proceeded to ask
questions in Chinese. But it was quite difficult to hear because there
was glass between us and I had to listen through the drive-through
quality speaker, and every time he started to say something it erupted
in feedback, so I always missed the first part of his question. I had to
ask him to repeat many times. I felt bad doing this, and I also just
generally felt nervous, something about these situations. He was asking
real basic questions that I should otherwise have been able to answer
well in Chinese (are you traveling by yourself, who are you staying
with, how do you know them, where did you study Chinese, etc.).
Eventually, after I asked him to repeat a question for the Nth time, he
gave up and stamped my passport.</p>
<p>萍圆 and her brother picked me up from the airport. He dropped us off
at the apartment. 萍圆’s mom just came back from getting some groceries.
She cooked us some noodle soup with pork, cabbage, celery—very
comforting after a long journey. Also ate lots of little side dishes
(cold lotus root and mushrooms in some kind of sesame sauce, cold salted
boiled chicken, some kind of sliced cold beef like corned beef). I was
fed two bowls of noodle soup, also 馒头 (mantou, a steamed bun, no
filling), also boiled okra. I was full. 萍圆 and I went for a walk after
dinner, or else I would have fallen asleep before 7pm. Had some fruit
after we came back. As soon as I hit the bed I was asleep.</p>
<p><img src="photos/apartment-outside.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /> <img
src="photos/apartment-inside.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /></p>
<h1 id="tue-sep-19">Tue Sep 19</h1>
<p>Breakfast: soybean milk, fried green radish, repeat cold dishes from
yesterday, leftover 乌鸡汤 (black-skin chicken soup), 馒头, two eggs. I
was full. Fruit and tea later, more full.</p>
<p>We had to go to the police station to register me as a foreign guest
staying with 萍圆 and her mom. 萍圆 had started her period and wasn’t
feeling great, so I went with 萍圆’s mom. It was raining so she called a
car. Police station was interesting, sort of exactly how I imagined—a
bit worn, Windows 7, lots of posters with party speak, I noticed one guy
had a mechanical keyboard at his desk, nice.</p>
<p>Of course, I had a hard time understanding everyone. At one point, an
officer asked me how old I was, seemingly just to make some
conversation, and I had trouble catching what he said (I thought I heard
“多大”) but eventually I answered. We were seated in what looked like a
meeting room (long table, phones, etc.) and it was steaming hot, no
airflow. This is where one officer talked to us, checked our documents,
and wrote some things down. He kept leaving, asking us to wait. I wasn’t
sure what we were waiting for. Eventually, we were told to come back
tomorrow.</p>
<p>Helped 阿姨 包 some 饺子 (make dumplings) for lunch, though I was
pretty slow. (“阿姨”, pronounced “ayi”, is how I address an older woman
around my mother’s age.) Ended up being fed three bowls of dumplings, I
was so full. It was a late lunch too, and I was still jet lagged, so I
took an hour+ nap. Woke up just in time for the next meal.</p>
<p>Met 萍圆’s brother, his wife, two kids, and his wife’s brother’s
daughter. We ate at a restaurant called 解家菜, specializing in cuisine
from Henan province. Lots of good food: whole spicy fish, unctuous
cabbage soup, sweet pear soup, that one lotus root dish, fried eggs with
young lotus leaves, blanched greens, fried sesame leaves, fish ball soup
(though the kids ate it all before I could get a single ball), rolled
山药 (sticky Chinese yam) dessert. 萍圆’s brother was very nice and was
chatting with me most of the time. We lamented (遗憾) that I wasn’t
drinking, and promised some 白酒 for next time. As usual, there were
moments where I didn’t fully understand him but he was patient and I
looked up a couple words in the dictionary. The kids were cute, funny,
and a little wild. I was so full.</p>
<h1 id="wed-sep-20">Wed Sep 20</h1>
<p>Woke up still full. 萍圆 and I took a walk before breakfast and
stopped by the neighborhood park. It was so lively in the morning. Tons
of people (though maybe mostly on the older side) using a shared
community space—exercising, dancing, playing music, sport, etc. Really
cool. Breakfast was: soybean milk, fried egg with red pepper, fried bok
choy, and this cured beef from 萍圆’s hometown which was really tasty.
Also I tried this deliciously simple condiment called 芝麻盐; it’s just
crushed up roasted sesame with salt, and you eat with 馒头, delicious.
Breakfast closely followed by medicine. (I should mention 萍圆’s mom
prepares traditional Chinese medicine for 萍圆 and, by extension, me.
It’s normally a bunch of ingredients boiled together into a brown
liquid. Pungent. Bitter.)</p>
<p>We were going to go back to the police station to get me registered,
but we called first and the one guy that needs to be there still isn’t
there so we’ll come back when we’re back from Hangzhou.</p>
<p>So then 萍圆 and I went off to three different book stores. The first
one was in a dilapidated, hollowed-out mall. It actually had a couple
kids books I should have picked up, oh well. The second one was nicer,
the third one was good too. We bought a few books.</p>
<p>Next, we went to the 烩面 (hui mian) place for lunch. This is a rich
lamb soup with thick, wide wheat noodles. It was really busy and hectic.
They do communal-type seating but at non-communal-type tables. We were
seated at what felt like a normal 4-top, but with 3 other pairs of
eaters. No bother, the 烩面 was really tasty; soup was great with a
healthy amount of 花椒 (Sichuan peppercorn), noodles good too.</p>
<p>After lunch, we walked through an older part of town which was quite
lovely. Older, not-as-tall buildings, narrower streets. I took a couple
photos. Our goal was this old neighborhood barber shop. I got my haircut
there (next to mostly old people) for just 15 RMB (like 2 USD). Not the
best one, but I had a hard time communicating what I was after.</p>
<p><img src="photos/zhengzhou1.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /> <img
src="photos/zhengzhou2.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /></p>
<p>After the haircut, we took a cab to the music place. The place itself
was located in the basement of a kind of shopping mall, except all of
the basement shops were sort of craft/maker spaces—saw some things like
pottery, calligraphy, other artsy things, neat. When we stopped in, the
teacher wasn’t there. After a little while she showed up, and she agreed
to give me an 二胡 (er’hu) lesson right then, one hour. She taught me
the basics: how to hold the bow (gong), the two main motions (gou, tui),
how to play the outer string (wai xian) and inner string (li xian),
do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do. She spoke a lot, and quickly. 萍圆 couldn’t
really keep up with trying to help translate. But it seemed okay, I was
able to sort of get it from watching her and piecing together her
instructions. After a little while we stopped, and were chatting about
other instruments. She let me play the 阮 (ruan) and 琵琶 (pipa), which
are more similar to guitar, while some young kid started his 二胡
lesson. It was a lot of fun. Maybe we’ll come back next week, I’m pretty
curious about the zither.</p>
<p>Home for dinner: steamed fish 多宝鱼 (real flat guy) and abalone,
fried greens, cold spicy pork tongue, rice (with sesame seeds, nice
touch). Followed by two bowls of medicine. The stuff is pretty potent
(bitter, with overtones of raisin concentrate); 萍圆’s mom’s advice is
to just slam it (喝得一干二净!).</p>
<h1 id="thu-sep-21">Thu Sep 21</h1>
<p>At the train station bathroom, saw a small sign in front of each
urinal that said, “向前一小步，文明一大步”. Translates to: “one small
step forward is one big step for civilation.” Genius.</p>
<p><img src="photos/train.jpg" /></p>
<p>Train between 郑州 and 周口, lots of corn fields and concrete block
homes. Feels like the mid-west.</p>
<p><img src="photos/hangzhou1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Made it to Hangzhou, a bit cloudy and rainy. Went to dinner at a 浙菜
(Zhejiang cuisine) restaurant called 弄堂里. Tasty! Apparently, Hangzhou
is home to quite a few restaurants that eventually became chains around
China, and this was one of them. (Aside: 萍圆’s mom doesn’t trust
restaurant utensils to be clean/sanitary, so she always asks for
disposable.) Then we went to a show at SONGCHENG, which is like a Song
dynasty version of Disney land. The show itself was fun. A mix of
dancing and acrobatics over classic ancient stories. The crowd was a bit
rowdy, lots of chatter, phones, hard-earned applause.</p>
<p>My stomach was really uncomfortable at night. It was harder than
usual to drink my nightly medicine. (Oh yeah, 萍圆’s mom brought a
kettle and prepared Chinese medicine for us while we were traveling. She
packs super light considering she only brought one backpack, and it
seems mostly filled with a kettle and Chinese medicine.) We stayed at
the Marco Polo hotel, an older hotel but still nice (fancy
Japanese-style toilet is always welcome).</p>
<p><img src="photos/hangzhou-night.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="fri-sep-22">Fri Sep 22</h1>
<p>Went to breakfast at some small, local shop. 小米粥、茶鸭蛋、包子. I
dig the local vibes at these little canteens, very informal.</p>
<p>After breakfast, I recorded my video for the CS TA orientation.</p>
<p>Walked to West Lake (西湖). It’s still drizzly and foggy, but that
makes for a nice vibe too at the lake; the pagodas lining the mountain
side seem a little more mysterious.</p>

<p>We took a boat to a little islet on the lake, where there are some
walking paths and old gates and rocks. Took photos with 萍圆 and her
mom.</p>
<p><img src="photos/xihu8.jpg" /> <img src="photos/xihu9.jpg" /> <img

<p>Got lunch at a famous dumpling chain; got dumplings and duck soup.
萍圆’s mom brought a red bell pepper with her (because she was afraid it
would go bad before we came back). When we were at the restaurant she
asked the staff if they would slice the pepper for us so we can eat it.
They agreed. We were all cracking up. Turns out she has a second pepper
to use sometime.</p>
<p>After lunch, we took a crowded bus to Lingyin temple (灵隐寺). The
area around the temple is beautiful, sitting within lush, green forests;
Buddhas carved into rock; little pagodas. It’s a real contrast to the
Starbucks, KFC’s, and McDonald’s lining the streets on the way to it.
When you pass through the turnstile there’s a recorded voice that says,
“阿弥陀佛” in a deep, droning voice, kind of funny.</p>
<p><img src="photos/lingyin1.jpg" /> <img src="photos/lingyin2.jpg" />
<img src="photos/lingyin4.jpg" /> <img src="photos/lingyin3.jpg"
style="width:49.0%" /> <img src="photos/lingyin5.jpg"
style="width:49.0%" /></p>
<p>Inside the temple, we offered incense, and knelt at the various
halls. (The ritual is, with some slight variations, you pray, then
kneel, and bow in a way that you touch your forehead to the ground three
times. This is called 磕头, and it’s where we get the word kowtow.)
While I had been to temples in Japan and Korea, I never participated in
any of these rituals, but 萍圆’s mom encouraged me to join, and I was
happy to do so. I felt lighter afterwards.</p>
<p><img src="photos/lingyin6.jpg" /></p>
<p>Our departure from the temple was delayed because the roads going in
and out were closed while the president of Syria and his family were
visiting, apparently. At the bus station we split with 萍圆’s mom, she
went back to the hotel while we went to meet 萍圆’s friend for dinner.
We met at a mall and ate a restaurant that seemed geared towards
families with small children (萍圆’s friend was accompanied by her
six-year-old daughter). It reminds me of family-type restaurants you see
in the States with kids books and crayons and whatnot, but the food is
actually good—we got roasted lamb ribs with steamed buns, green squash
soup, cold noodle salad, some kind of rice cake thing.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we went with her friend to her apartment in an older (but
pricier) neighborhood in Hangzhou. Apparently, Jack Ma lived in this
neighborhood before he got rich. We were greeted by her husband and his
mother. They were all kind and welcoming, gave us fruit to eat (柚子, my
favorite). We spent the evening chatting in front of the TV (they have a
little desktop projector that looks really clear, we should get one).
The two shows we watched were 兰闺喜事 (historical type show but kind of
silly, I’d like to watch more of it) and 加油 向未来 (a sort of
science-type show geared towards kids with stunts/experiments in front
of a live audience). Their kid was super cute and energetic, bouncing up
and down. She did a couple dances for us, sang a couple songs. She was
really into 加油向未来. She also had a skit she performed in English
where she pointed at her dad’s pants and asked, “What color?”, and
received the answer, “It’s blue.” Scene.</p>
<p>I was up a little late putting the video together for the CS TA
orientation.</p>
<h1 id="sat-sep-23">Sat Sep 23</h1>
<p>Got breakfast around the corner (小笼包、葱油拌面、青菜粥). Then, we
dropped our bags at the hotel lobby and left for Longjing (龙井).
Traffic was crazy backed-up because Mr. Xi was staying somewhere in the
area. It turns out this weekend was the start of the 19th Asian games
(taking place in Hangzhou), making traffic even worse than typical for a
weekend.</p>
<p>It was still raining and foggy, but this weather made Longjing
especially beautiful. The green hillsides lined with rows of tea, the
hilltops obscured by fog, quaint village buildings nestled below. We
hiked around the paths on the hillsides and took photos.</p>
<p><img src="photos/longjing1.jpg" /> <img src="photos/longjing2.jpg" />
<img src="photos/longjing3.jpg" /> <img src="photos/longjing4.jpg" />
<img src="photos/longjing5.jpg" /> <img src="photos/longjing6.jpg" />
<img src="photos/longjing7.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then, we stopped off at a tea shop and drank some of that famous
龙井茶. We drank some of the premium “old tree” tea (老树), running
about $1 per gram, and ended up buying 120 grams of the cheaper
stuff.</p>
<p>After that we grabbed a cab to a famous nearby restaurant for lunch.
There are other locations around China, but here was the original. We
got 东坡肉, whole fish with a sour sort of sauce, that lotus root
stuffed with sweet rice dish again, some delicious greens (黄花菜), fish
soup, shrimp cooked in 龙井茶. 萍圆’s mom even asked them to slice up
another red pepper that she brought, and they did! Incredible.</p>
<p><img src="photos/longjing8.jpg" /> <img src="photos/longjing9.jpg" />
<img src="photos/longjing10.jpg" /></p>
<p>After lunch, we went back to the hotel to collect our bags. Walked to
the subway (super crowded, learned a new word from 阿姨, “拥挤”), and
made our way to the train station. 萍圆 bought us business-class tickets
for the return journey. We sat in the business-class lounge before
departure. 阿姨 filled a whole bag full of free snacks and drinks from
the lounge. Business-class seats were too nice. We sat in a cabin that
seats only 5 people, the seats fully recline, more complimentary snacks
and drinks, meal service, too nice.</p>
<p>It seems the rain is following us back to Zhengzhou…</p>
<p>Film note: I shot a whole roll of Cinestill 400D in Hangzhou (I think
there were a few black and white frames from the previous roll of HP5).
Then, on the train I loaded some Tri-X 400.</p>
<p>Made it back to Zhengzhou. Had a quick medicine before bed. This is
the one that tastes like chocolate; this makes 阿姨 laugh. It’s made of
turtle shells and antler “glue”. I ask what this medicine is supposed to
do and I don’t quite understand the answer. 萍圆 summarizes that it’s
supposed to be good for my liver and kidneys. For the rest of my time
here, she would jokingly call the medicine she brews “chocolate” (i.e.,
“time to drink your chocolate!”).</p>
<h1 id="sun-sep-24">Sun Sep 24</h1>
<p>Rainy day. Finished reading Murakami’s running memoir. Breakfast:
fried tofu and greens, seasoned boiled quail eggs, mantou, that cured
beef from 萍圆’s hometown, soybean milk with black beans.</p>
<p>萍圆’s two nieces came over today. At one point I left with 萍圆’s
mom and sister-in-law to go to this market to buy fish, shrimp, and
vegetables. Her sister-in-law drives a manual Chevy Cruze. The trip was
a little awkward, there were a few things in the conversation I missed.
The market itself was cool, live seafood hawkers, butchers, produce,
grain, noodle shops, mantou shops. We bought live shrimp and a whole
perch (which they killed and cleaned right there). I walked off with the
bag still twitching.</p>
<p>At home, 萍圆’s older niece (her family nickname is 雪妮儿, which as
best as I can translate means “snow girl”, because she was born in
winter) and I were playing a little drawing game where we would take
turns drawing something, I would try to guess the Chinese and I would
give the English word. It was fun. 阿姨 cooked the fish and shrimp with
fresh Longjing tea leaves she picked during our walk through the 茶园
yesterday.</p>
<p>Not everyone puts diapers on their kids here. 萍圆’s youngest niece
doesn’t. Something about diapers not being very breathable? If they
gotta go they try to announce it or they just pee all over themselves
and their surroundings, which I suppose is what we’ve done for most of
human history.</p>
<p>After lunch, 雪妮儿 and I played another drawing game where she would
draw a shape and I would finish the drawing with whatever I saw from
that shape; then we would switch. For example, I drew a spiral and she
finished it as a snail. We played this game for what seemed like the
whole afternoon. There were some silly doodles, it was fun. As usual, I
don’t always understand what she says, but I follow along as best I can
and look up words in the dictionary. There were also moments where I
would try saying something and just fumble it, making a sentence that
doesn’t entirely make sense, and she just gives me a blank look and
continues (which is really all you can do sometimes).</p>
<p>There’s a popular gadget with kids here that looks like a smart
watch, except it’s a standalone phone you wear as a watch. 雪妮儿 has
one, and at one point I was surprised because she took a call on it from
a friend of hers. It seems it can take calls, play some audio stories,
maybe some little games. The watch even flips up perpendicular to the
band and has a little camera on it! This is some real Dick Tracy stuff;
I dreamed of having a gadget like this when I was a kid.</p>
<p>The kids call me “叔叔” (Shu-shu) and call 萍圆 “姑姑” (Gu-gu), which
is how a kid would address an older man and woman who is around the age
of their father and mother, respectively. It’s kind of cute.</p>
<h1 id="mon-sep-25">Mon Sep 25</h1>
<p>Went to the hospital today. Just like 萍圆 described to me, it is
chaotic. Swarms of people, no notion of a queue, just pushing and
squeezing to the front of any counter that will accept whatever you
shove over. We registered me at the first floor and I got my own patient
card. Then, we went upstairs to the third floor to join the wait for a
gastro doctor. We select doctors much like you order food at a
McDonald’s, at a big touch screen. Some doctors are around 15元, more
experienced ones are around 30元. At the gastro clinic, there was one
doctor named 保洁 (which literally translates to “janitor”). I’d like to
imagine that if you chose this doctor you would be seen in the janitor’s
closet. Maybe he does a good job.</p>
<p>The waiting room itself was chaotic. Swarms of people, talking,
yelling, on phones; hospital staff giving orders over microphones. Some
old woman was bent over, spitting on the floor. Old man doing snot
rockets in the trash bin. Even when we were just putting in an order at
the touch screen, some random person would butt in and try swiping their
card like they were going to commandeer our order. 萍圆 told them to go
to the other screen.</p>
<p>After a little while, we got to see the doctor. When the automated
queue system called my name, the robot voice just spelled it out instead
of pronouncing it like the Chinese names in the queue
(<code>Z-A-C-H-A-R-Y...</code>). 萍圆 explained my stomach issues, and
she and 阿姨 suggested various tests that the doctor should order. I
couldn’t follow much of this. The doctor suggested an endoscopy
procedure, but that would require knocking me out. (I can always do one
in California.) At several points during the consultation, patients
tried barging into the room, and the doctor would yell at them to wait
outside. At another point, a hospital worker came in and changed the
ink, or toner, cartridge for the printer. Anyway, lots of tests were
ordered. I guess that’s why they needed more ink.</p>
<p>Time to draw some blood. We went up to the fifth floor (there is no
fourth floor). Drawing blood just happens out in the open. Imagine a row
of counters with glass dividers, like reception desks or teller windows,
but instead you stick your arm through and they just draw the blood
there. Very efficient.</p>
<p>But we’ve only just drawn the blood. Just standing here with three
vials of my blood and a bunch of slips of paper. Now we have to take it
to the right lab ourselves. Divide and conquer is the strategy. 阿姨
grabbed one vial of my blood and went off to some floor of the hospital
to drop it off. 萍圆 and I took the other two. Just getting to different
floors of the hospital is difficult. There are twenty-some floors, but
the elevators are really slow, and some only go to certain floors (like
odd-numbered, even-numbered). We needed to get to the 18th floor (we
were on the fifth). Fed up with waiting for the elevator, I suggested we
take the stairs. I noticed on the higher floors there were spittoons in
the stairwell filled with water and cigarette butts. We trudged up to
the 12th floor and 萍圆 wanted to stop and check if we could drop the
blood off at one of the labs there. Turns out they could do <em>one</em>
of them. Okay, so we hiked up to the 18th and dropped the last one off.
But we’re not done here. At this same floor, I take some kind of
breathing test to check for some bacteria in my stomach. I fill a
plastic pouch with my breath, then they have me drink water with some
powder in it (I forget, urea something…), then wait 30 minutes and blow
into another pouch.</p>
<p>Next test! 阿姨 was kindly holding my spot in line at the cardiac
ward (seemingly one of the few places that had proper queues). Here, I
lie down, pull my shirt up, and the medical staff apply some cold liquid
to my skin and put clips on my wrists and ankles, and suction cups all
over my chest. All wired up. 萍圆 told me to relax. These apparently run
some current through my body and they can check how my heart is
doing.</p>
<p>Okay, on to the last test. The most fun test. We need urine and fecal
samples. This proceeded fairly straightforwardly, though I must admit
I’ve never done a fecal sample before. They give you a plastic tube and
the lid has a little scoop attached running down the center of the tube;
so you open it, take a scoop, and close the lid. This was also the first
time I used a squatting toilet. It’s actually a fairly comfortable way
to poop, 9/10.</p>
<p>The last thing we did was go to a skin doctor about my dry and itchy
scalp. This guy was one of those big-shot 30元 doctors. He sat at a
table flanked by medical students. I feel like he wasn’t really that
helpful though. 萍圆 described my symptoms and he said he knew what to
prescribe. He wasn’t even going to look at my scalp until 萍圆 asked him
to. He prescribed some kind of antibiotic (which I think I’ve tried
before), so whatever. It’s a real rapid fire kind of care. You need to
be able to describe what’s wrong in a quick one liner, not a lot of room
for nuance. There were literally other patients waiting around this same
table for us to get out of the way.</p>
<p>So that’s day one of the hospital. We actually have to go back
tomorrow morning for an ultra sound to look at my guts.</p>
<p>I was fasting all morning, so I was hungry after all this fun. We
walked down the street, past a bunch of tasty food stalls, and split a
肉夹馍. Then, we got a bowl of tomato noodle soup at 阿利茄汁面, a
famous chain. 阿姨 went outside a couple times to a food cart and bought
some steamed noodles, steamed vegetables with flour, and porridge and
brought it into 阿利’s to eat with our food.</p>
<p>Driving here seems pretty hectic. I’m not sure I could do it. There
are traffic rules, but they are seldom followed. We’ve been in a lot of
cars over the last week and I saw some wild maneuvers, especially during
rush hour. This is epitomized in our trip to the hospital today. The
hospital is situated at a huge roundabout, and the main road entering
the roundabout is endlessly clogged. I feel that the reason it is backed
up is because no one actually follows the traffic lights. This includes
pedestrians; they just cross the street whenever and where ever they
want. This, of course, slows down traffic because they have to
constantly stop for random pedestrians. I’m no logistics expert, but if
cars actually followed the lights at the roundabout and pedestrians
actually waited for the crosswalk sign, I feel it wouldn’t be so bad,
but what do I know. There are traffic cops at this particular spot, but
they don’t seem to really do anything. It just feels like everyone is
trying to get their way through without caring about anything else.
Another observation: many of the intersections are <em>vast</em>; it’s
just begging for people to snake around.</p>
<p>Another note about driving. Since we’ve been in a lot of cabs this
trip, I’ve seen a lot of different dashboards. Some of these cars have
as many as two screens (one in the center, one behind the wheel), and
often a taxi driver has two smart phones mounted somewhere on the dash
(one work, one personal). As much as a Luddite as I tend to be, I have
to admit this looks pretty cyber punk.</p>
<p>After chatting with 萍圆 about some of these observations, I have a
better understanding now. There are several reasons: (1) conditioned
resource scarcity; in the hospital, for example, some folks are
traveling in from far away and are trying to get a bunch of shit done in
one day, they’re going to fight for the front of the line, (2)
poor/underfunded management (of hospital, for instance), (3) Zhengzhou
is more corrupt than say Shenzhen, for example. The higher-ups running
the city just don’t care. Shenzhen is a richer city, and less corrupt;
you would get fined for doing dangerous maneuvers on the road (as a
pedestrian or on a vehicle). It has richer hospitals that are better
managed. In the end, though, I wouldn’t be bothered too much by these
things; it’s just different from what I’m used to.</p>
<p>Dinner: abalone (鲍鱼), fried green eggplant and tomato, flour and
egg soup, mantou.</p>
<h1 id="tue-sep-26">Tue Sep 26</h1>
<p>Day two at the hospital. We got there a bit late this morning and
missed my spot in line for the ultrasound, so I had to rejoin. It took
about 1.5 hours for my name to called (spelled). Ultrasound revealed
tiny, probably benign, cysts around my thyroid gland, inflammation in my
gall bladder, and a bit of calcium build up on my prostate. Nothing to
actually be worried about, but good to know for future check-ups as I
get older. We checked into a couple other things, printed a bunch of
reports of the results from yesterday’s tests, and left. Lunch was at a
porridge place around the corner, 八宝粥.</p>
<p>After our hospital trip, 萍圆 and I got a foot massage. This starts
with soaking our feet in warm water while the masseuse works on our neck
and shoulders. Then, our feet are washed, and each one worked out. At
times it’s a bit painful, they really find those nerves, but overall
feels great. Each masseuse commented how 帅 (handsome) I was before
realizing I understood them. Towards the end, the masseuse working on me
commented that I had “性格文静” (i.e., a quiet and gentle disposition),
which she followed up saying, “like a girl”. At this, my face turned
red. Even if I didn’t 100% understand, I understood. This also lead to
comments on my red face and white skin. We left for home feeling
refreshed.</p>
<p>Hung out for a bit at the apartment, ate fruit, played around with
萍圆’s old digital camera and SD card.</p>
<p><img src="photos/pingyuan-camera.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then we left again to try to find those Feiyue shoes for Conrad. The
shop we wound up at certainly had the Feiyue logo and some shoes, but it
definitely looked liked it and the surrounding shoes shops were mostly
hawking fakes. We’ll probably just order the shoes on Taobao. We stroll
around the area, and stop by a 烧饼 cart. Looks like the guy and woman
were preparing for their evening. The woman squatting on a stool
preparing some 串, the guy rolling out discs of dough, working in some
oil and sesame seeds. We asked him to make up a fresh one for us so it’d
be piping hot. His heat source is this kiln sitting atop the cart. He
takes a stretched out dough disc and slaps it on the side of the kiln to
cook it. 2 RMB, mega cheap, and a nice snack.</p>
<p>We walk to that sad mall with the bookstore we went to last week. I
say it’s sad because it seems like most of the shops are closed and the
escalators don’t even run; we just use them as stairs. At the bookstore
I browse for kids books that seem interesting to me, an adult. I settle
on a few, ranging in difficulty.</p>
<p>When we get back to the apartment, 阿姨 and 雪妮儿 are just getting
back too. 雪妮儿 teaches me how to use a 字典 (Chinese character
dictionary), walking through the process of looking some characters up
through component radicals and stroke order, etc. Eventually, she tires
of this (I’m probably not much for conversation) and starts watching TV,
which becomes difficult to pry her from once dinner is ready. Dinner is:
多宝鱼, shrimp, 排骨汤 (pork rib soup), noodle vegetable soup.</p>
<p>I dropped my old iPhone on the tile floor in the bedroom. I was just
pulling it out of my pocket, probably to look up some Chinese word in
the dictionary, and slips out and hits the floor face first. The screen
is terribly cracked, there was even bits of glass on the floor. Oh well,
it was a good phone.</p>
<p>Taking a walk around the block in the evening we encountered an old
woman on a bike pulling a cart full of 粽子, a sort of sticky steamed
rice snack. Her cart had a loud speaker with a looping recorded message
that went, “粽子，热粽子，香米热粽子”, over and over and over. It
actually sounded kind of melodic yet slightly eerie in the quiet dark of
the evening, echoing off of the empty streets and tall buildings. I
asked 萍圆 to record it on her phone. Ask me to sing it for you.</p>
<h1 id="wed-sep-27">Wed Sep 27</h1>
<p>This morning, 萍圆 and 阿姨 went to the hospital for another test. I
stayed home and had a call with a masters student, Zechen, about him
getting involved with research this quarter, and giving some advice on
his PhD applications. I was mainly hanging around on my laptop all
morning, and around noon I heard a knock on the door and it was 萍圆’s
brother and niece. They came to pick me up to meet 萍圆 and 阿姨 for
lunch at a Cantonese-style restaurant. Lunch was really tasty; here’s
what I remember: shrimp dumplings, cold steamed chicken, 蟹黄豆腐, some
kind of fried greens that come from the leaves of silk worm trees(?),
fried wide rice noodles with pork, chicken wings, salted egg yolk
custard buns, papaya soup, pigeon soup.</p>
<p>After lunch, we all took a nap. Then, we finally returned to the
police station so we can fill out a form and have some guy give it the
official stamp for registering me as a foreign guest. After that, we
stopped by a Chinese medicine ingredient shop so 阿姨 can get some raw
materials. Some interesting stuff in there: sliced antler, 25-year old
tangerine peels, various roots, seeds, and flowers.</p>
<p>Kind of an uneventful day. 萍圆 and I did a bit of gift shopping
online. I was configuring my text editor; planning some things and
scheduling meetings for next week. Oh, I also tried lamb brain and lamb
face with dinner. Not bad! Brain is a bit soft, almost like pâté.</p>
<h1 id="thu-sep-28">Thu Sep 28</h1>
<p>Breakfast today included pig heart (and maybe tongue?), also not
bad.</p>
<p>We grabbed a long car ride to 少林寺 (Shaolin Temple). Before we
left, 萍圆 and 阿姨 insisted I get some long socks (I only packed
no-shows) since the hike would be up in the mountains and colder. We
stopped by the convenience store near the apartment and 阿姨 bought me a
pair of navy crew socks that said “FBI” on the side.</p>
<p><img src="photos/shaolin1.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /> <img
src="photos/shaolin2.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /> <img
src="photos/shaolin3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Once we got to 少林 it started raining, and soon it started raining
cats and dogs. We were ushered onto a little cart, which took us to
entraces for different cable cars up the mountain. All along the way
there are employees accosting us for this and that: tour guides, cable
car tickets, food, etc. Really sort of irritating. It seems unnecessary
as there’s literally no other choice for any of these services. The
cable car tickets are all the same. The food is all the same. The tours,
same. It just feels shiesty. When anyone does that to me I immediately
think I’m getting scammed. It’s just the workers here are paid more for
how many tickets they sell—which is just shitty management.</p>
<p>We did take a cable car ride—floating over the forrest, views into
the valley, mountain peaks breaking out of the thick fog.</p>
<p><img src="photos/shaolin6.jpg" /> <img
src="photos/shaolin7.jpg" /></p>
<p>At the top, we walked along the trail for a bit until we reached a
food spot. We got some steamed noodles, and ate some fruit. Then, we
started a trail that leads to a hanging bridge somewhere high up. It
rained all the while, fairly steady at times. There were moments when
the dense fog broke and we could glimpse something in the distance:
trees, mountains, rocks. We didn’t make it to the bridge. Our feet were
soaked and we couldn’t see much anyway. We made our way back.</p>
<p><img src="photos/shaolin8.jpg" /> <img src="photos/shaolin10.jpg"
style="width:49.0%" /> <img src="photos/shaolin9.jpg"
style="width:49.0%" /> <img src="photos/shaolin11.jpg" /></p>
<p>The cable car ride down the mountain passed through such heavy fog we
couldn’t see anything except the cables hanging over us and the
occasional car passing by on its way up. Everything else was thick, gray
fog.</p>
<p>The temple itself is honestly nothing to write home about. I think my
bar was set too high by Lingyin temple in Hangzhou; 萍圆 says that’s
about the best temple in China. 少林寺 is indeed old. There are some
wicked old trees and vines that look quite cool. The temple grounds
themselves are a bit small. Still nice, but Lingyin was a whole other
experience.</p>
<p><img src="photos/shaolin4.jpg" /> <img
src="photos/shaolin5.jpg" /></p>
<p>Took a taxi back to Zhengzhou. When we got back home, the power was
shut off. Turns out 阿姨 forgot to pay the electricity bill. No matter,
she got it turned on soon enough.</p>
<p>We’re planning on going to Luoyang (洛阳) Saturday for a day trip.
There’s no rain in the forecast yet, but there wasn’t today either…</p>
<h1 id="fri-sep-29">Fri Sep 29</h1>
<p>Another morning at the hospital. More tests. 萍圆 and I did some
genetic type tests, see what kind of baby we’ll make. We’ll get the
results in a couple weeks. 萍圆 met her father’s side of the family for
lunch (lots of drinking and smoking). One of 萍圆’s father’s cousins is
apparently a devout Buddhist, and everything he said at lunch was
somehow related to Buddhism. He, aside from 萍圆, was one of the few not
drinking and smoking at lunch. He also doesn’t eat meat, and he goes to
the temple everyday to perform some kind of ritual. Seems like a cool
dude, it’d be nice if I could talk to him about Buddhist stuff next
time.</p>
<p>阿姨 and I got 烩面 somewhere else (the same place 萍圆 and I went
before). The 烩面 place was just as crowded as last time. We were seated
across from an older couple who looked at us a bit curiously. 阿姨 is
quick to talk and be friendly. This outcome was honestly easier for me.
The place is so loud and hectic, it’s easier if they’re all talking
dialect and I can’t understand anyway. 阿姨 made sure I wasn’t hungry or
even close to anything less than 100% full. She ordered two cold side
dishes to go with our bowls of noodles; one was some kind of greens with
sesame paste sauce, the other beef tripe in chili oil. She even forcibly
gave me some of her noodles.</p>
<p>After lunch, we walked to the Chinese medicine hospital, and got me
checked in here with a Chinese medicine doctor who will look at my
stomach issues. The set up is almost exactly the same as the other
hospital we went to, except they prescribe Chinese medicine. The doctor
even takes my pulse and looks at my tongue, just like in the TV
shows.</p>
<p>I get prescribed a month and a half of some medicine concoction
that’s supposed to be good for my stomach. The doctor also advises me to
not eat cold, raw, or spicy foods. Also to eat 养胃的 (in a way that’s
nourishing for the stomach) which basically means more warm, nourishing
foods.</p>
<p>萍圆 had an appointment at the same hospital with a doctor about
fertility stuff. In all, we were done well after 5:30. It was a long day
waiting in hospitals. 萍圆 and I walked to the nearby mall and did a bit
of shopping for my family. Tonight is the mid-Autumn festival, so tons
of people are out. The moon is also big and full and bright. The CCP’s
birthday is also this weekend, so that’s also sort of co-opting the
weekend festivities, it seems. Tons of Chinese flags. Tons of young
people taking photos of themselves with flags. A gross amount of
patriotism. 萍圆 says the younger generation has been particularly
brainwashed towards nationalism.</p>
<p>We catch a cab back towards the apartment and meet 阿姨 at the
地锅柴鸡 chicken place. This is the kind of place where there’s a giant
iron wok in the center of the table. We pick chicken, goose, dried long
bean and mushrooms, 冬瓜, and greens. The staff come by and fry the meat
and dry ingredients in the wok. Then add water and cook about 25
minutes. Towards the end they slap on a few corn 饼 (like Johnny cakes)
on the sides of the wok. The one woman working our table noted I was a
老外 (foreigner) and made some conversation with 萍圆 about me in their
dialect, so I could barely follow. Later, they asked me how much 河南话
I could understand. I say, “河南话三分听懂”. This was apparently the
right answer, it got a good laugh out of 阿姨. (I should have said
“河南话能听懂三分” to be grammatically correct.)</p>
<h1 id="sat-sep-30">Sat Sep 30</h1>
<p>Up early to catch the subway to the train station. Off to 洛阳
(Luoyang)! We just barely make the train. 萍圆 upgraded our seats again.
Very nice. It’s only a forty minute ride.</p>
<p>We get off the train and see some huge historic building off in the
hills. Waiting for us outside the train station: 萍圆’s cousin 萍萍
(Ping-ping), her husband, their daughter, and her husband’s niece
Xing-xing. We load up in their massive Toyota SUV and head to 龙门石窟
(the Long Men Buddha grottos). It’s a holiday weekend, so it’s packed
with people. The sun is also out with a vengeance after being hidden
from the rain and clouds all week.</p>
<p><img src="photos/luoyang1.jpg" /> <img
src="photos/luoyang4.jpg" /></p>
<p>It’s a long walk in the sun to the stone Buddhas, and there are
frequent stops with the little one. But that makes it a good time to
chat with everyone. 萍圆’s cousin speaks decent English, probably the
best out of everyone I met this trip. Xing-xing is also studying English
and she was curious about me being a 外国人 (foreigner), though she is
shy. 萍圆 encourages me to speak English with her, and we break the ice
with some easy questions (“how old are you”, etc.). Turns out she’s been
learning the 古筝 (zither) for five years. That’s super cool. I tell I
like playing music too.</p>
<p><img src="photos/luoyang2.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /> <img
src="photos/luoyang3.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /> <img
src="photos/luoyang5.jpg" /></p>
<p>The main stone Buddha carvings are wicked cool to see in person. They
big. We took a river boat back to the front. There is more to see, a
whole loop to do, but the sun was too strong.</p>
<p><img src="photos/luoyang6.jpg" /> <img src="photos/luoyang7.jpg" />
<img src="photos/luoyang8.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /> <img
src="photos/luoyang9.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /> <img
src="photos/luoyang10.jpg" /></p>
<p>We had lunch at a dirty road-side restaurant. Beef soup with one of
those big biscuits on the side that you tear off into chunks and soak it
in the soup. Delicious. For a snack, they also had these little 丸子
just made out of seasoned fried dough strips rolled together in a ball.
Crunchy.</p>
<p>After lunch, we drove out into the country side to go to the 二里头
(Er’litou) archaeology museum. In the local dialect, “二” (er) is
pronounced “e”. This set me up for the perfect pun. 萍圆 said, “we are
going to E’litou”, and I say, “a little what?”, and 萍圆’s cousin says,
“a little museum!”</p>
<p>The museum is out in the sticks because that’s where they uncovered
remains of the Xia dynasty from like almost 4000 years ago. This museum
had lots of pottery and burial knick-knacks. The most noteworthy
artifact are the cups they used for drinking alcohol. The cup looks like
a cross between a gravy boat and a mocha pot. 干杯！ Museums are tiring
though; lots of walking and reading and imagining.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we were standing outside the museum waiting for 萍萍’s
husband to get the car. 萍圆, 阿姨, and the little one were running
around playing. I was chatting with 萍萍 and Xing-xing. I showed
Xing-xing my old film camera and she took a photo with it (next
photo).</p>
<p><img src="photos/alittle.jpg" /></p>
<p>Xing-xing asked me some more questions, like how many classes I took
in middle school, how many siblings I have, that sort of thing. 萍萍
asked me if I would ever come work in China. She really missed 萍圆; she
said they were like sisters growing up. I said I would love to work in
China if the opportunity came.</p>
<p>Back in the car, we drove back into the city. We reviewed some
English words with the little one (alligator). Traffic was pretty bad in
the city, especially where we were heading. On our way in, we passed the
old city gates, which were lit up for the holiday. Our destination was
the historic district. Here we walked around small streets filled with
food carts and vendors. I took some night photos here, hopefully they
turn out decent.</p>
<p><img src="photos/luoyang11.jpg" /> <img src="photos/luoyang12.jpg" />
<img src="photos/luoyang13.jpg" /></p>
<p>萍圆 bought a big cup of sticks skewered with slices of cow or pig
stomach basted in some spicy sesame sauce and shared with everyone. They
were really tasty but I was only permitted to eat two because the sauce
was rather spicy. We passed by an old man sitting at a table drawing
bookmarks with a caligraphy brush. I took a couple photos of him at
work, and 萍圆 bought a bookmark. The old man signed and dated the back
of the bookmark when we bought it. His wife helped run the table and
deal with transactions. Their pace was much slower and deliberate than
the frantic energy around the rest of the street, but that was nice.</p>
<p><img src="photos/luoyang14.jpg" /></p>
<p>We also stopped in a ceramics shop and I finally bought a tea cup. We
also stopped at a table selling some wooden combs and such. We bought a
wooden scalp massager. I kept thinking I should buy a bracelet with the
wooden beads, but I don’t know, I’m not sure if I really wear that sort
of thing. Or maybe I would if I got one. Would I actually use it for
meditation? It’s supposed to be like a rosary-type thing. I suppose I
should have gotten one at Lingyin temple. Oh well. Next time.</p>
<p>We stopped at a restaurant near the train station for dinner. We were
pretty tight on time, and by the time we got our noodles we had just ten
minutes to slurp them down. Before we left, 萍圆’s cousin gave me a gift
of a clay tea pot made from an apparently reknowned craftsman, as well
as some 普洱茶. This seems like a really nice gift. I’m looking forward
to brewing some tea when we get back.</p>
<p>Luoyang was quite nice. I had a fun time with 萍圆’s cousin and her
family. 萍圆 seemed quite happy to spend the day with them. Maybe
sometime in the future we can live closer.</p>
<h1 id="sun-oct-1">Sun Oct 1</h1>
<p>This morning we went to one of the famous 胡辣汤 breakfast joints.
It’s a thick, brown soup with lots of pepper, slices of meat, and some
other savory stuff I couldn’t identify. 萍圆 and I each got a bowl with
some soft tofu on top. We also got a big basket of bing and little fried
dough sticks, as well as some pan-fried buns with beef filling. The soup
was too dang spicy for me (it’s in the name), and so I just ate the tofu
on top and ordered a bowl of soy milk to drink instead. 萍圆’s brother
says there’s a place that does a non-spicy version of 胡辣汤, maybe next
time.</p>
<p>萍圆 and 阿姨 went to the property management office to get their
faces scanned for the gate entrance. I had the opportunity to get mine
scanned but I declined. Then, we went for a bit of gift shopping and
stopped off at an outdoor market before heading home. At the market, we
passed the usual stalls that have live seafood, as well as frogs and sea
snails and some shark-looking fishes. We also passed a stall selling
live chickens and ducks and geese. One woman running a chicken stall
came up to us and asked about me, where I was from (her first guess was
England). Then, she asked if I would take a photo with her younger
daughter, I consented. That was kind of cute and funny; it’s the first
time that’s ever happened.</p>
<p>阿姨 cooked up crab she bought at the market. It was tasty but I’m
not very good at dismembering crabs. There was some darker bitter goop
inside the crabs, and 阿姨 surmised this was from Japan recently
releasing the Fukushima waste water into the ocean. We doubted that. Nap
time.</p>
<p>For dinner we met 萍圆’s brother’s family at a hot pot restaurant in
a mall. Hot pot is always tasty. We got sliced beef, black-skin chicken,
duck feet, duck blood, tofu, octopus, meat balls, shrimp paste, noodles,
bunch of different veggies and probably some other stuff I’m forgetting.
At the end, we celebrated 萍圆’s real birthday. Her brother bought a
nice cake. It had tons of fruit on top: mango, blueberry, strawberry, as
well as sliced strawberry on the sides. The cake had two layers with one
black sugar filling and a berry filling. The sweetness level is always
spot on with Asian-style cakes, never so sickeningly sweet as an
American birthday cake. We also sang happy birthday to 萍圆 to which she
was embarrassed. The lyrics in Chinese work out pretty well with the
original melody: “祝你生日快乐～”</p>
<p>萍圆’s brother gave us a lift back home. In the car, the littlest one
had to pee, so she announced as much (“尿尿!”), and 萍圆’s brother
pulled the car over, picked her up out of the car, pulled her pants
down, and she just peed on the side of the road.</p>
<p>So that’s it, the last full day in China. I wish I took photos of
more everyday happenings to accompany my travelogue. Oh well, I’ll try
to get better at that.</p>
<h1 id="mon-oct-2">Mon Oct 2</h1>
<p>We packed everything this morning. We ended up borrowing a smaller
suitcase from 阿姨 because we have a lot of books and Chinese
medicine.</p>
<p>阿姨 says I’m weak. Once we get back to California she tells me I
need to exercise everyday, “one hour in the morning, one hour in the
evening.” I tell her next time I come back to China I’ll be strong. She
chuckles.</p>
<p>Made it to the airport just in time. Her brother drove us, with 阿姨
and 雪妮儿 tagging along. Weirdly enough, when we were driving to the
airport, Hotel California came on the playlist. The serendipity of this
song playing seemed lost on everyone else in the car. Her brother
couldn’t find parking in the airport parking structure, so he did what a
handful of others did and just parked right in the way, blocking two
other occupied parking spots. The family lead us to the departure area
and we said our goodbyes.</p>
