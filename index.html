        <b>A Formalization of Data-flow Integrity for Understanding Non-control Data Vulnerabilities in Binary Programs: </b>
        This research considers non-control data vulnerabilities in binary programs. 
        Attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities are harder to detect because they respect the legitimate control flow of the program and by-pass current defenses such as ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention). 
        Non-control data attacks are capable of harming systems through information leakage, permissions escalation, and arbitrary code execution. 
        This research proposes a formalization of data-flow integrity for binary programs by defining the formal semantics of an intermediate language that binary code is lifted to. 
        By using formal methods we hope to answer the following questions:
        <ul>
            <li>What properties must be present to guarantee the presence of non-control data vulnerabilities in a given program?</li>
            <li>Can these properties be algorithmically extracted from a binary program?</li>
            <li>Does an implementation of the formal method reduce the false positive rate compared to previous implementations?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <b>A Semantics-Based Approach to Concept Assignment in Assembly Code: </b>
        Zach is currently researching using formal methods to model the <i>concept assignment problem</i> for assembly language representations of programs. 
        The <i>concept assignment problem</i> (also referred to as <i>concept location</i> or <i>feature location</i>) is the problem of mapping concepts to locations in a program.
        This is difficult in assembly because assembly instructions lack semantic information and higher-level programming constructs compared to source code representations of programs. 
        Automating concept assignment improves a reverse engineer's comprehension of executable software by determining what concepts and features exist in a program.
